# The Big Top Application

## Development

Run the following commands (they must be run in separate terminal windows as `ionic serve --no-open` is blocking)
 
    ionic serve --no-open
    electron .

## Scaffolding

The scaffolding for this project was generated using the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/) 
(version 3.16.0) and the blank template:

    ionic start big-top --no-cordova blank

Run `ionic g page page-name` to generate a new page.

You can also use `ionic g [page|component|directive|pipe|provider|tabs] [element name]`.
